## Systems Forum

The aim of this project is to provide a common StackOverflow like community for engineers where they can discuss their topics of interest and vote for the best answers. The project is based on the Biostar project and planned to improve it's core features without rewriting the whole code base. For me it's more like playground where I can learn new techniques and test them in the wild. If some feature got your interest feel free to take it and use it.
